Added more MacOS options to form.

Optimized by Jonathan Hardwick (jch[at]cs.cmu.edu), 3/28/96
Compare to Linkpack.java.
Optimizations performed:

 - added "final" modifier to performance-critical methods.
 - changed lines of the form "a[i] = a[i] + x" to "a[i] += x".
 - minimized array references using common subexpression elimination.
 - eliminated unused variables.
 - undid an unrolled loop.
 - added temporary 1D arrays to hold frequently-used columns of 2D arrays.
 - wrote my own abs() method
